# Pineapple Rewards System

## Overview

Pineapples (🍍) are the gamified currency in Vamo that reward consistent daily progress. They are earned through daily logins, uploading evidence, and achieving streak milestones. Pineapples can be spent to reveal potential customers in the "Find Customers" feature.

## Earning Pineapples

There are three ways to earn pineapples:

1. **Daily Login Bonus** - Automatic credits for logging in each day (scales with streak)
2. **Evidence Credits** - Bonus credits for uploading evidence (diminishing returns per day)
3. **Milestone Bonuses** - One-time rewards for achieving major streak milestones

### 1. Daily Login Bonus (Streak-Based, Weekly Increases)

Your daily login bonus increases as you maintain your streak, with weekly tier improvements:

| Streak Range | Credits per Login |
|--------------|------------------|
| Days 1-7 | +5 🍍 |
| Days 8-14 | +6 🍍 |
| Days 15-21 | +7 🍍 |
| Days 22-28 | +8 🍍 |
| Days 29-100 | +10 🍍 |

**Important:** If your streak breaks, the daily login bonus resets back to +5 credits (Week 1 rate). You must rebuild your streak to reach higher daily rewards again.

### 2. Evidence Credits (Diminishing Returns)

Each piece of evidence you upload earns credits, with diminishing returns throughout the day:

| Evidence Upload | Credits Earned |
|----------------|----------------|
| 1st of the day | +10 🍍 |
| 2nd of the day | +5 🍍 |
| 3rd of the day | +3 🍍 |
| 4th+ of the day | +0 🍍 (daily cap) |

**Maximum evidence credits per day:** 18 🍍 (10 + 5 + 3)

### 3. Milestone Streak Bonuses (One-Time Rewards)

Achieve major streak milestones to unlock large one-time bonuses:

| Milestone | Bonus Credits |
|-----------|--------------|
| 7 day streak | +50 🍍 |
| 30 day streak | +100 🍍 |
| 60 day streak | +150 🍍 |
| 100 day streak | +250 🍍 |

**Important:** Milestone bonuses are **lifetime rewards**. Once claimed, they cannot be earned again:
