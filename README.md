### 📊 Relationship Tags (Warmth Score)

**Know them well = 70-80%**
- This is a warm lead, you have an existing relationship
- They trust you already, much more likely to buy
- Color: Green or dark green

**Talked once = 40-50%**
- Medium warmth, there's some connection but not strong
- They know who you are but relationship is new
- Color: Yellow or orange

**Don't know them = 15-25%**
- Cold lead, no existing relationship or trust built yet
- Hardest to convert, lowest likelihood
- Color: Red or light red

### 📈 Stage Tags (Progress Score)

**Set up call = 20%**
- Just starting, very early stage
- Most leads drop off here
- Color: Light gray or pale blue

**Discovery call = 35-40%**
- Made it past first contact, showing interest
- Still early but better than setup stage
- Color: Blue

**Demo = 55-60%**
- Invested enough time to see a demo, serious interest
- Over halfway there
- Color: Purple or medium blue

**Pricing call = 75-80%**
- Very close to closing, discussing money means they're serious
- High likelihood of conversion
- Color: Yellow-green or lime

**Secured = 100%**
- Done deal, paying customer
- Color: Bright green

**Did not close = 0%**
- Lost the deal
- Color: Red or gray

### 🎯 How to Use Both Together

The **relationship tag** tells you the baseline probability based on how well you know them.

The **stage tag** tells you how far along they are in the buying process.

You could even combine them: If someone is "Know them well" (70%) AND at "Demo" stage (60%), that's a very strong lead with high conversion likelihood. But if they're "Don't know them" (20%) and only at "Set up call" (20%), that's much riskier.

The colors help you visually scan and see which leads are "hot" (green/yellow) versus "cold" (red/gray).

- **Vision Board Aesthetic**: Pinterest-style grids and aspirational design

---

All app state is managed with Zustand and persisted to localStorage:

- Pineapple credit balance
- Evidence uploads library
